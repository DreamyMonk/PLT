# **App Name**: PLT Overlay

## Core Features:

- PLT File Upload: Allow users to upload PLT files from their local machine.
- Image Overlay: Enable users to upload an image and overlay it on the PLT file.
- Adjustment Tools: Provide tools for adjusting the size, position, rotation, and transparency of the overlay image.
- Intelligent Adjustment Tool: Suggest optimal positions of the overlay on the PLT file. The AI tool uses the image and the structure of the PLT file to predict proper position of the images.
- Exporting and sharing: Ability to save a link of the exported PLT.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to create a professional feel, without calling attention to itself.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4F8) that doesn't distract.
- Accent color: Indigo (#5C6BC0) to highlight key actions and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for clean and modern UI.
- Use simple, consistent icons from a library like Material Icons for common actions (upload, adjust, save).
- A split-screen layout with PLT viewer on one side and overlay/adjustment options on the other.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during file loading and image adjustments.
